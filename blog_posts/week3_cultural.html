				<h2><em>how an Abstract Random thinker is navigating DBC</em></h2>

				<h3>The Lowdown</h3>
					<p>
						I've often been curious about one thing that I will literally never know: what is the world like from someone else's brain? Even the people most similar to me- my parents, my siblings, my boyfriend- we all think about the world differently. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Prior to DBC's Phase 0 we had to take a thinking style quiz. When I got my result back, <em>abstract random thinking style</em> I wasn't in the least bit surprised. Most of the descriptions of the style (below) were pretty dead on. I do think that in my time at school I've worked really hard to overcome discomfort with things like "giving exact details", "working with authoritarian personalities" or "accepting even positive criticsm"- however I'm sure I still have ways to go.

					<p>
						Putting this thinking style exercise into the larger perspective of my DBC struggles so far is also not surprising. I'm a multimodal learner, which means I like to hear things ten different times in ten different mediums before I feel like I know it. Similarly, during Phase 0 so far I've felt the best about topics I've gotten to read lots on, experiment with and hear others explain to me. The work has been hard mainly because it's so time consuming to do that for everything given how much work we have. I think one strategy to deal with this would be to ask DBC instructors to help me "prioritize" which topics are worth going extra in depth on and which ones I can research just to the point of having a decent grasp on.  
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition to the time priority plan, I can also invoke my growth mindset and try to be comfortable learning without so much research. Looking back over my reflections from the last few weeks has made it clear that I can spend way too long looking over and researching a problem that looks daunting, when really once I start it it all becomes clearer. I think I need to start being confident in my ability to tackle a problem without having read all the material about it I can get my hands on.
