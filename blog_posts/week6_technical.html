				<h1 id="functional vs. OOP">Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
				<h2><em>Understanding the Difference</em></h2>

				<h2>The Lowdown</h2>
					<p>
						Initial research online reveals a war that has been happening right under our noses: that between functional programming enthusiasts and their Object-Oriented counterparts. Here I'll go through some of the key differences of each. To start off, I found this quote quite helpful for orienting myself:

						"The functional approach to programming is to ask "how is data constructed?". This leads to a style of programming where the data constructors are considered primitive, and where data-consuming code accordingly is defined by pattern-matching over these constructors. The object-oriented programmer instead starts out by asking "what can we do with the data?", which fosters the view that it is the data selectors that should be seen as foundational, and that the code of a data-producer consequently should be defined as an enumeration of implementations for these selectors." (Nordland)

				<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						Remember in elementary and middle school when you saw a chart that looked something like this?

					<p>
						Well Functional Programming utilizes a similar approach when analyzing and operating on data: if two things have matching input and output types, you can compose them into code. For example <em>g(f(x))</em> takes the output of <em>f(x)</em> and inserts it as the input for <em>g(x)</em>. Therefore the operations are fairly versatile and the data is not tightly tied to any particular operation (function), as compared to OOP.
					</p>

				
				<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						Think of Object-Oriented Programming as a package deal: when you get one object or class, it comes tightly packed with all of its data and ways to operate on that data. When working in OOP you're adding new methods or operations to each specific object or you're creating new objects.
					</p>

					<h3>Comparing the Two</h3>
					<p>
						The war that I've discovered seems a bit out of place after gaining a deeper understanding of FP vs. OOP. It appears that OOP has great benefit for adding a level of abstraction to the Functional Programming backed databases of many large organizations. OOP makes it easy to change the way things are put together, while Functional Programming makes it easy to add new operations across an entire span of data. Both of these approaches are important to creating a fantastic system.
