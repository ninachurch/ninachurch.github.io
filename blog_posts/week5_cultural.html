				<h2><em>a reflection on pair programming and giving feedback</em></h2>

				<h3>The Lowdown</h3>
					<p>
						I'm a big believer in the absolute importance of feedback. I've been very fortunate to study at Stanford's d.school or design school, which views feedback as paramount. Getting to the point where I welcomed feedback was challenging, and still is. However I've seen the power of kind, actionable feedback to really improve my work and my life. Dev Bootcamp's focus on feedback was one of the things that drew me toward it, and below is a reflection on the DBC feedback process so far.
					</p>

				<h3>The Process</h3>
					<p>
						Pairing has been a fun and rewarding experience. It's amazing how much faster I progress through the challenges when pairing with someone else. I have found that taking a few minutes at the beginning of each session to really be human and connect with the other person helps make the session more productive and more enjoyable. It also pays back in the end because I can give them feedback more directly related to their personal objectives. This can be difficult at times, in particular if I am not sure if my feedback is correct since I'm also a a beginning programmer. However I try to be very honest and direct with my feedback.
					</p>

				<h3>Rating Other's Feedback</h3>
					<p>
						I'm so excited that people at DBC seem to be kind and caring. However in rating meta-feedback I've been pretty disappointed. It seems like people are so afraid of hurting the other person that little feedback ends up happening, if any at all. I've seen many posts that focus on the writer's <em>own</em> strengths and weaknesses, and don't offer any actual feedback.
					</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
						I think that with time and some tough love we DBC'ers will realize the value in being honest and frank with our feedback. It's a huge favor to give someone feedback, and I'm thankful to be part of a program that not only encourages but demands it.
