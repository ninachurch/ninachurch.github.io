				<h2><em>Making Instance Methods in Ruby Class Definitions</em></h2>

				<h3>The Lowdown</h3>
					<p>
						If you have looked into Ruby at all you probably are aware of class methods, or things that do things to different objects. For example arrays and hashes have their own methods that you can call on any array or hash and the object will understand what to do. For example you can call <em>array.map</em> or <em>array.each</em>. But what if you want to make your own class and have it do something? That's where instance methods come in.
					</p>

				<h3>Creating an Instance Method</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Start by using <em>def</em> and the name of your desired method.</li>
						<li><strong>If you need any user input, pass it in in <em>()</em>. </li>
						<li>Fill in the method with the functions of your choice. Maybe you want some loops to perform an action on your input, or maybe you simply want it to return something.</li>
						<li>Be sure to close it out with <em>end</em>.</li>
						<li>Once you've created your method within the Class definition, you can use it on any new class object that you create!</li>
					</ul>
