				<h2>A Guide on Choosing the Right Language for You</h2>

				<h2>The Lowdown</h2>
					<p>
						Whether you're a complete newbie or a knee deep programmer, you've likely heard of both Ruby and Javascript. Use this guide to help you decide which language to go with!
					</p>

				<h2>Ruby</h2>
					<h3>Pros</h3>
					<p>
						Ruby is an intuitive programming language. Both JavaScript and Ruby are dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need descriptors that indicate what type of information you're putting into every method. However Ruby is often rated as a more friendly syntax than JavaScript.
					</p>

					<h3>Cons</h3>
					<p> 
						Many people would still consider Ruby a "fad" that will pass soon. People say that to make Ruby as intuitive as it is, there are many "layers of abstraction" that seperate the programmer from what's actually happening, which can provide security and other sub optimal issues.
					</p>

				
				<a href=JS><img src=http://cfile10.uf.tistory.com/image/242FE24A53452822311D6B title="JavScript" /></a>
				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
					<h3>Pros</h3>
					<p>
						JavaScript is "the Browser of the Web" because it allows you to work on the backend and integrate seamlessly into the front-end. This is incredibly consistent and convinient. It is also growing in popularity, and speed now that Google's V8 Javascript Engine exists.
					</p>

					<h3>Cons</h3>
					<p> 
						There are many weird idiosyncratic things that the language does, in particular in syntax. It also doesn't allow you to simplify quite as much as Ruby.
					</p>

				<h2>Comparing the Code</h2>
				<p>
					Here is a comparison of the same code. This is for an array, which is a way of storing information. While you can see that the code is fairly similar, the methods vary from Ruby to JavaScript. Can you guess which one is Ruby, based off what you've learned?
				</p>

				<p>
					Ready for the spoiler? Ruby is on the left-hand side. You can see that it's slightly more straightforward and simpler.
