				<h1 id="stereotype threat">Stereotype Threat</h1>
				<h2>A Personal Refelction</h2>

				<h2>The Lowdown</h2>
					<p>
						<em>Stereotype Threat</em> is an interesting psychological phenomenon coined by Stanford professor Claude Steele. The theory states that people perform worse when they are aware or reminded of a negative stereotype directly related to them and their performance. For example young African-American college freshmen and sophomores performed worse on exams when reminded of their race. 
					</p>

				<h2>My Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I came upon a <a href="http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/swps/SWPS101_2013/refSpencerSteeleQuinn_StereotypeThreat.pdf">great paper based on the dissertation of one of Professor Steele's students, </a> which applies stereotype threat to women in math. This was particularly impactful to me because, despite being a firm believer in growth mindset, I've always struggled to view myself as capable at more mathmatical tasks. It started when I was young and wasn't the most stellar in the class despite working incredibly hard, and at a certain point I sort of just resigned that it wasn't my strong suit. As very few girls continued on to be superstars in AP Calculus BC in high school but many boys did, I can't help but look back and wonder if stereotype threat was real.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm thankful for the opportunity to participate in DBC for a multitude of reasons, but this research makes me excited about it from a whole different perspective: getting the chance to prove stereotypes wrong. A friend of mine who is a computer science major at Stanford told me that "the unfortunate reality is that unless a girl is a senior software engineer, her ability to program will always be questioned more than a man's." I find this statement to be a tragic reality. I look forward to working to change it!
