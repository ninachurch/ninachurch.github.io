				<h1 id="blogTopic">JavaScript is Sexy</h1>
				<h2><em>what everyone needs to know about the oh-so-popular JavaScript</em></h2>

				<h3>The Lowdown</h3>
					<p>
						JavaScript is a programming language that you interact with most of the time you're online. It's a powerful tool that can be used to turn static webpages into ones that are easy to interact with. 
					</p>

				<h3>JavaScript vs. HTML vs. CSS</h3>
					<p>
						Why do we need JavaScript if we already have front-end languages like HTML and CSS to make our web pages work? The best way is to take a look at what each of these scripting languages let us do. HTML is where we start to build out the content of a site. Let's say you run a dog rescue center, and want to create a site where people can go and contact you about either a dog they've found or about buying a dog you've rescued. First, you'll use HTML to write out the content of site. Maybe you'll write about yourself, the kennel, and put up some pictures of the dogs you have.
					</p>

					<p>
						Once you've used HTML to write out the content, then you'll use CSS to "make it pretty". After all, no one just wants to look at text on a page, right? Maybe you want to make the site match your logo colors, you want to center the pictures of your dogs, and make the web page responsive (so that people can view it easily on their phones, different web browsers, or other devices.)
					</p>

					<p>
						Great. Now you've got a nice, informative web page. So where does this JavaScript sexiness come in? Let's say you want to create a form for viewers to submit whether they have a dog they want to send to the kennel and you also want to create another form for if they want to buy a dog from the kennel. As it stands, if the user wanted to input this information the page would have to completely reload. This may not seem that bad, but it's a hassle for the user and can also be complicated on your side.
					</p>

					<p>
						Instead, you can add in some JavaScript so that your site is converted into an interactive site that users can input information into without needing to reload the whole page. Less hassle for them may mean a better turnout for you! This is part of the sexiness of JavaScript. However as you go about your JavaScript education, be aware of the pros and cons of it, listed below.
					</p>

				<h2>Pros</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ease:</strong>JavaScript is fairly straightforward and not overly time consuming to learn.</li>
						<li><strong>Speed:</strong>JavaScript offers a speedy experience for the site user.</li>
						<li><strong>Variety:</strong>JavaScript allows you to add lots of different features and functions to a website.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Cons</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Security:</strong>Since JavaScript is executed through the web browser, sometimes JavaScript is used as the delivery system for harmful code.</li>
						<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>JavaScript is a "client-side script" meaning that the web browers (client) reads and interprets it. Some web browsers may interpret it differently than others, throwing your initial design off. </li>
					</ul>
