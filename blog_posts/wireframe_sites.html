			This homepage is aptly dealing with the challenge of displaying lots of different, potentially clashing and busy designs all at the same time. One of the most effective ways it does this is by "staying out of the way" with very small, neutral text and navigation that doesn't draw attention away from the borders. The padding added between each of the designs also provides nice visual spacing to keep the images from becoming too crowded, in particular with the varying sizes.

			This page is one of the stops you can find when trying to discover a playlist using the tag system. The tags at the top with the plus signs make it clear what you're supposed to do, but give you easy acces to playlists as you go. The use of photos draws your attention down towards the playlist. The spacing of this page is interesting, which I've never noticed until just now: what would normally be the right sidebar is actually more centered than right. I'm not sure what the motive behind this would be besides to keep users engaged with their profiles. However this page as a whole exemplifies 8tracks superiority to other music sharing apps.

			This website is a bit tricky to wireframe, since it's really more of an interactive animation. It does a good job at keeping the potential curious and engaged as they scroll through and get exposed to the product, however it's cuteness and simplicity definitely have a drawback in that you don't have much incentive to buy except at the very end. The designers worked around that here by putting a static header at the top that has the option to Pre-Order
