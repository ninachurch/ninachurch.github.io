				<h3>The Lowdown</h3>
					<p>
						Have you ever watched a balloon burst? Or poked a bubble with your finger on a hot summer day? Maybe you've gotten a little risqu√© and stuck your finger into your friend's bubblegum masterpiece.

						If you've seen any of the above phenomenon, then you know the joy, excitement, awe and effort that come before the loud, dissapointing pois weekend, I sat down for an insider interview with a roomful of Silicon Valley junkies and that feeling was all I could think about. In the room: four incredibly successful technical startup founders, a CEO coach, a German entrepreneur, and me. Despite realizing that the fact I was the only girl in the room symbolized an important problem in the tech world, bigger issues arose. The interview developed into a talk of a Valley filled with investors who have too much money, aspiring entrepreneurs who have too little technical knowledge, and a witty and bitter tech-ocracy.
					</p>

						"Here's what it comes down to. In the Valley, you may meet someone who is working on a 'startup'. Unfortunately, most people don't understand the economics of venture capital. Venture capital firms fund companies that they hope will be able to return their entire fund. This means that they fund companies that have some chance at having a billion dollar exit. Unfortunately, unless you are friends with someone who has had a company funded by a top tier VC (and I mean a founder, and I really mean a solid VC, because I'd be wary of people who's companies have been funded by questionable 'angels'), then be highly highly highly highly skeptical of any company your friend has. Most startups are shit. Most people who are funded aren't really funded. 98% of the Valley is shit."
