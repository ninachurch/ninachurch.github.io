				<h2><em>exploring the HTML DOM system</em></h2>

				<h5>The Lowdown</h5>
					<p>
						Today, making a basic website is not only empowering but also important. Websites themselves are actually quite straightforward: they're just a series of boxes. When you put any element- a picture, a text, a link- on the page, it is put into a "box". That box is then surrounding by padding and a border, which go inside the larger margin and finds a place on the page. If you can get a grasp on the these three components, you're well on your way to understanding and even making your own websites.

				<h5>Padding</h5>
					<p>
						Let's say we're inserting a paragraph of text onto the website. The page views this as an <em>element</em>, and draws a box around it. You can then decide if you want to add some <em>padding</em> around the box. This would come in handy if you wanted to seperate different elements on the page, or if you want your paragraph to have a border you may want to add some padding so that the text isn't pushed right up against the box. 
					</p>

				<h5>Borders</h5>
					<p>
						Borders are pretty and practical. You can put a border around your individual elements to add some detail, or you can put borders around larger elements to seperate the page into different sections.
					</p>

				<h5>Margins</h5>
					<p>
						Margins offer a barrier of seperation between different elements. You can adjust this to change the space between different elements and the sides of the pages. If you set the margin to auto, the browser autocalculates it.
					</p>

				<h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>padding</strong>it's the packing peanuts, the wrapping paper, or the foam that goes around the gift (in this case that gift could be an image, paragraph, anything you want on your page) before you put it in your box.</li>
						<li><strong>Borders</strong>are the boxes your gift and gift wrap go into. </li>
						<li><strong>Margins</strong>seperate your boxes from other boxes. </li>
					</ul>
