				<h1 id="blogTopic">Three Websites to Live By</h1>
				<h2><em>a deeper look into three of my favorite websites</em></h2>

				<h3><a href="http://designspiration.net/" target="_blank">Designspiration</a></h3>
					<p>
						I recently came across this site and truly can't get enough. 
						The site displays different designs from various portfolios and ads. But these aren't your normal ads- they're the most artistically stunning ones out there. The site design is sleek and responsive- it ends up being engaging whether you're a professional designer or just a lover of beauty. The site includes lots of cool features, like being able to search by color palletes and tag your favorite designs. It's incredibly helpful when doing any sort of design or just trying to find cool images for anything. Despite the fact that some of the designs are ads, the site does not feel spammy- probably because the original advertisements are not paid to be there. Rather I think the way the site monetizes through its job listing function, where people and businesses can post design-related job openings.

				<h3><a href=" http://8tracks.com/" target="_blank">8tracks</a></h3>
					<p>
						Have you ever experienced the pure satisfaction of getting to take a break from your own music and listen to a friend's playlist who has really good taste? 8tracks lets you do that on the regular, except your "friends" are random people all over the world who share your taste. I've been going on this site at least once a day for years now, and have never experienced a better UX. It uses a tag system that allows you to pick different moods you're in and outcomes you want from your listening experience, and recommends you various playlists that have been uploaded by all sorts of people all around the world. The site is visually attractive, intuitively simple and exciting. No matter what mood I'm in, the site is a welcomed part of my daily routine.
					</p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.kano.me/" target="_blank">Kano</a></h3>
					<p>
						While this isn't much of a site to revisit, when I first stumbled upon it I must have gone through it at least a dozen times. It's a sleek, entertaining and fun site that markets a new kickstarter product: a computer that kids can physically build and program on their own. What makes this site so different from others is the flow- starting from the top and working your way down you move easily through the different images which tell a story through their animation. While I don't have kids, I would certainly buy this if I did!
					</p>

				<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>flow</strong> is so important</li>
						<li><strong>simplicity</strong> is not overrated</li>
						<li>a UX that <strong>rouses emotion</strong> is a memorable one</li>
					</ul>
