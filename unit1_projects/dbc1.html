		<h1>My Story</h1>
		<a href="http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120118/640/cute_animals_640_02.jpg"> <img src="http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120118/640/cute_animals_640_02.jpg" alt="Link to the cutest picture ver"/> </a>
		<p> I was born on July 6, 1993 in North Carolina before moving to Ohio for six years then growing up mostly in sunny San Diego, California. After having some inspirational people challenge my family and me to dedicate our lives to bettering the world, we began travelling throughout the developing world and founded a social enterprise, <a href="
			http://nikawater.org">Nika Water,</a> that donated 100% of its profits towards alleviating poverty through education and clean water/sanitation. </p>
		<h2>What Now?</h2>
		<p>My wonderful family and all the amazing opportunities I when I was younger gave me <em> a deep love for channeling energy into making important systematic world changes.</em> It led me to Stanford University, where I'm currently a sophomore studying Science, Technology and Society. I'm deeply passionate about education and excited by the potential for business and technology to make important change in social sectors.</p>
		<h3>Why DBC?</h3>
		<p>Does anything sound cooler!? 9 weeks of growing, learning, pushing and developing skills I think will be crucial to anyone in a few years. Most importantly, as I look at the big ways in which I think education needs to change, I realize just how important programming is- <strong> it's becoming the new mode of creative expression as well as an important way to revolutionize industries and solve problems. </strong> I want to be able to better engage with those who have serious talent as programmers to tackle some of these challenges, as well as be able to do the programming myself when possible.</p>
		<h4>What Next?</h4>
		<p>Next fall I'm taking the quarter off from Stanford to focus on some personal and project development- I'm so looking forward to it! <br> 
			I <br/>
			love <br> 
			it <br>
			here <br>
			so <br>
			much, <br>
			but think that challenging myself to get some perspective will be important to my personal and academic growth.</p>
