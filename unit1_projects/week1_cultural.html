				<h1 id="blogTopic">DBC: A Fireside Chat</h1>
				<h2> <em>reactions<a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank"> to Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> </em> </h2>
					<p>
						From the moment I got into DBC, I've been both excited and apprehensive. I know that this is going to be incredibly challenging, in particular because I've really never been a technical person- but I am all about that growth mindset! This talk made it pretty clear that we will be dedicating a lot of time and energy not only to the technical skill building but also to building ourselves as people and teammembers. This really excites me, and I love that "startup" like energy that I think this whole experience will take on.

						One thing this chat did make me realize is that I will likely be a bit younger than everyone else in the program. While I'm very excited to grow and learn from everyone, I hope my lack of life experiences like having an actual full time job won't prevent the bootcamp from being worthwhile. Shereef's words were comforting when he talked about people from all levels having something to offer, even if all our technical skills are in the same general range. I was also surprised and a bit relieved when he mentioned that a lot of our Phase 0 work is stuff that would have previously been covered in the bootcamp: it was an exciting glimpse into just how much we're about to learn!
