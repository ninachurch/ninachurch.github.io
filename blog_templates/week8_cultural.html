                    <p>
                        The last time I had an emotional conflict, I was with my family, traveling. We had all just been to the beach together, and we were about to embark on our next step. 

                        Earlier that week, we had been to a shopping center at the request of my mother. 

                        This day, it turned out that she wanted to go back again, to visit a specific shop and buy something. I was a little frustrated at this, because I hoped that I wouldn’t have to go along to the shops. My frustration at my mother showed, and she became upset at me when I asked her to hurry up far more than I should’ve. In this case, I suppose I was on the east side of the compass, in the “attack others” direction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The source of this conflict was primarily on communication. I should’ve realized that it was important to my mother to go back and make this purchase. I wish I’d known this in advance so I could have bought a book to entertain myself. I wish I’d communicated my frustration in a healthier manner, rather than my brash comments to hurry up.

                        Unfortunately, my actions made the conflict worse in this case. I could’ve just found something else to occupy myself, rather than getting frustrated, making my mother frustrated, and making me frustrated again! 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If I could’ve gone back, I would’ve ensured that at the beginning of the day we had a short communication regarding the plan for the day. Then, I would’ve known what was ahead, and it wouldn’t have come as a surprise, so I would’ve already become used to the knowledge that I was going somewhere that I didn’t particularly want to go. If this hadn’t happened, and I had to change it at the time of conflict, I would’ve accepted the unchangeable fact rather than expressing useless frustration, and either gone for a walk or done some writing.

                        I learned that expressing frustration where it will not change anything only serves to make people unhappy. Also, bring books wherever you go! They are the best absorber of idle time.
